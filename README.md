## <samp>Hi there üëã</samp>

<samp>My name is Jade. 
I'm a Web Developer for Dora Maar, a luxury e-commerce marketplace powered by Shopify. In this role, I specialize in crafting user interfaces using Liquid Templating Language, along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My primary responsibity involves rendering and dynamically displaying muses for users to explore products tailored to each muse's unique taste and style. <br>
I enjoy building full-stack applications. Through discovering new features and implementing RESTful APIs, I'm able to incorporate these new features and stay up-to-update with the latest technologies!<br>
Before transitioning into my current role, I've held various roles within the luxury industry for 7 years. It was my most recent role in E-commerce sparked my interest and passion to further pursue a career in software engineering.
