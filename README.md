## <samp>Hi there üëã</samp>

<samp>My name is Jade.
I'm a Shopify Developer at Driver Digital, an agency specializes in software development for fashion and beauty brands. I enjoy crafting aesthetically-pleasing user interfaces. My primary responsibity involves developing reusable components using Liquid and TailwindCSS for new features and/or the overall website development.<br>
Before my career transition into tech, I've held various roles in luxury industry for 7 years. It was my most recent role in E-commerce sparked my interest and passion to further pursue a career in software engineering.
